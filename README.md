# 🐍 Reinforcement Learning Snake Game

This project is a self-learning Snake game built with **Python** and **PyTorch**, utilizing **Deep Q-Learning** to train an AI agent to play the game efficiently. It features custom gameplay logic, a deep neural network model, and real-time training visualization.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns by interacting with the environment through rewards and punishments.
- **Deep Q-Learning**: A neural network approximates Q-values to predict the best action for each state.
- **Experience Replay**: The agent remembers past experiences to learn more efficiently.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for training visualization)
- OOP Concepts
- Custom game logic using `pygame`

## 🛠️ Key Components

- `SnakeGameAI.py`: Game logic using pygame.
- `model.py`: Deep Q-Network (Linear_QNet) and training class (QTrainer).
- `agent.py`: Agent logic including state representation, action selection, and memory training.
- `helper.py`: Real-time plotting of training progress.

## 📦 Installation & Run
